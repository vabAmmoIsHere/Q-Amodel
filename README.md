# Ques-Ans Model

There various ways a Ques-Ans model can be made,for eg. using text generation, or document search through query string and cosign similarity, or even paraphrasing. It completely depends on the use case of the model. For our use case, we need:
1) A model to understand the context of the question and generate a query
2) Find question and answers of similar pattern by their cosign distance
3) Building answer skeleton and finally creating a polished answer
